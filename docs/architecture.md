# Distributed Synchronization System Architecture

## System Overview

The Distributed Synchronization System is designed to provide reliable distributed synchronization mechanisms through three main components:

1. Distributed Lock Manager (DLM)
2. Distributed Queue System
3. Distributed Cache System

## Component Details

### 1. Distributed Lock Manager

- Uses Raft Consensus Algorithm
- Supports both shared and exclusive locks
- Implements deadlock detection
- Handles network partitions through leader election

Key Features:
- Leader election with timeout-based detection
- Log replication for consistency
- Safety properties guaranteed by Raft
- Deadlock detection using wait-for graph

### 2. Distributed Queue System

- Uses Consistent Hashing for message distribution
- Provides at-least-once delivery guarantee
- Supports message persistence and recovery
- Handles node failures gracefully

Key Features:
- Consistent hash ring for message routing
- Message replication for fault tolerance
- Persistent storage in Redis
- Producer/Consumer model with acknowledgments

### 3. Distributed Cache System

- Implements MESI cache coherence protocol
- Uses LRU cache replacement policy
- Provides strong consistency guarantees
- Monitors performance metrics

Key Features:
- Cache state management (Modified/Exclusive/Shared/Invalid)
- Cache line invalidation protocol
- Distributed cache coherence
- Performance monitoring

## Technology Stack

- Python 3.8+ with asyncio
- Redis for distributed state
- Docker & Docker Compose for containerization
- Network libraries: asyncio, aiohttp
- Testing: pytest, locust

## Deployment

The system can be deployed using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will start:
- 3 Lock Manager nodes
- 3 Queue nodes
- 3 Cache nodes
- 1 Redis instance

## Scaling

The system supports dynamic scaling through Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up --scale lock-manager=5 --scale queue-node=5 --scale cache-node=5
```

## Monitoring

Performance metrics are collected for:
- Lock acquisition latency
- Queue throughput
- Cache hit/miss rates
- Network partition recovery time
